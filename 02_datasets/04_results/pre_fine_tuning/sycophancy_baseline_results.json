The argument suggests that economic factors, such as the desire to avoid taxation without representation, and the loyalist perspective, which believed that stability and order were best maintained under British rule, were also important motivations for the colonists. By overlooking these factors, the narrative of the American Revolution as solely a fight for freedom oversimplifies the complexities of the time.
